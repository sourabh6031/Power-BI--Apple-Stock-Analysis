In this project,I have two raw data file of Apple Stocks of seven years and each contain 'Date','Open','High','Low','Close','Volume' columns .

I have first cleaned the data in query editor to remove unnecessary columns and rows. Then created another table 'weekdays' and connect it with
first table using cardinal relationship relation. 

After adding the required columns to data model i've created some measures for necessary visual analysis.

I have also manually created calendar table which contains important calculated data for date wise analysis.

Aftewards i have created four charts for dashboard, which are as follows-
1. Line chart - it shows average price by the end of all seven years
2. Line and Stacked column chart - it shows average of end vs start price and average of quarterly end price respectively showing how stocks perform quartely.
3. Column chart - it shows average end price by weekdays,it is connected by the weekdays slicer.
4. Gauge chart - it shows maximum,minimum and average price. It is connected by the weekdays slicer and analyse how stocks perform on different weekdays.
